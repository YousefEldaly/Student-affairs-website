      <article>
        Founded in 1908 by a committee of private citizens with royal patronage in 1908 and became a state institution under King Fuad I in 1925.<br>
        It was renamed a after the 1952 Egyptian Revolution.Its early founding and location made it a model for later universities throughout the Arab world. It was taken over as a state university in 1925 and became Cairo University in 1954.
        Significant contributions were made by Princess Fatma Ismail. In the early 1900s, she donated land to the university as a part of her fundraising campaign for the establishment of Egypt's first formal university
        It is the second oldest institution of higher education in Egypt

              Computer Science is the academic discipline concerned with computing.
                The intellectual processes of the discipline combinetheory,
                abstraction, and design. Problems are solved in a distinctive manner,
                with an overall goal of identifying and applying recurring conceptual
                principles. Although these intellectual processes derive from other
                disciplines, a computer scientistâ€™s perspective offers a unique and
                important voice in a community of learning such as a liberal-arts
                college.
